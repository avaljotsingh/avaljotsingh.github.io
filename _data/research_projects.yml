# Formal Methods for AI (pipeline: specification → verification → execution)
fm_for_ai:
  intro: "I build languages, verifiers, and compilers so that neural network analyses (e.g. certifiers for robustness) can be specified declaratively, checked for soundness, and executed efficiently. The following projects form a coherent pipeline: specification → soundness verification → compiled execution."
  projects:
    - title: "ConstraintFlow"
      description: "A declarative DSL for writing neural network certifiers based on abstract interpretation. Specifications are concise and amenable to both automated verification and compilation."

      venue: "SAS"
      img: "assets/img/constraintflow.png"
    - title: "ProveSound"
      description: "Automatically verifies that certifiers written in ConstraintFlow are sound (over-approximate). This ensures that any robustness certificate produced by the certifier is mathematically valid."

    - title: "Neuton"
      description: "A tensor-based compiler and runtime for executing ConstraintFlow specifications on hardware. Enables efficient neuron-level analysis of neural networks."

# AI for Formal Methods
ai_for_fm:
  intro: "I use AI and synthesis to automate formal methods and program analysis: generating new certifiers, generating program optimizations, and assisting theorem proving."
  projects:
    - title: "SAIL"
      description: "Synthesizes new neural network certifiers automatically. It uses the ConstraintFlow DSL, its verifier (ProveSound), and its compiler (Neuton) to produce sound abstract interpreters optimized for a given cost objective."

    - title: "RuleFlow"
      description: "Generates reusable data-processing and Pandas optimizations using LLMs combined with compiler techniques. Discovered optimizations are turned into rewrite rules and applied automatically."

      venue: "arXiv"

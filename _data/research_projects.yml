    - title: "ConstraintFlow"
      description: "ConstraintFlow is a declarative domain-specific language for specifying neural network certifiers and analyses. It provides a compact and modular way to express abstract interpretation-based certifiers, significantly reducing implementation complexity compared to hand-written implementations."

    - title: "ProveSound"
      description: "ProveSound automatically verifies the soundness of neural network certifiers written in ConstraintFlow. It checks that a certifier implementation correctly over-approximates the concrete neural network semantics, providing formal guarantees about the correctness of certification algorithms."

    - title: "Neuton"
      description: "Neuton is a compiler and execution framework for ConstraintFlow specifications. It translates high-level declarative certifier specifications into efficient executable implementations, bridging the gap between formally specified analyses and practical large-scale neural network verification."

    - title: "SAIL"
      description: "SAIL automatically synthesizes new neural network certifiers by leveraging the ConstraintFlow DSL together with its soundness verifier and compiler. It explores the space of certifier designs and produces new certification procedures that are correct by construction."

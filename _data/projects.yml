- title: "Formal Methods for AI"
  description: |
    Making neural networks trustworthy via verification and soundness guarantees. This direction includes all **ConstraintFlow**-related work: a DSL for specifying and verifying DNN certifiers, a tensor-based compiler and runtime, automated verification of certifier soundness (ProveSound), and interpreting robustness proofs (ProFIt). Also the broader use of abstract interpretation for DNN verification.

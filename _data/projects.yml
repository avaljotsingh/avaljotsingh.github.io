# ConstraintFlow
- title: "ConstraintFlow (DSL)"
  description: "ConstraintFlow is a declarative domain-specific language for specifying neural network certifiers and analyses. It provides a compact and modular way to express abstract interpretation–based and constraint-based certifiers, significantly reducing implementation complexity compared to hand-written implementations."

# ProveSound
- title: "ProveSound"
  description: "ProveSound automatically verifies the soundness of neural network certifiers written in ConstraintFlow. It checks that a certifier implementation correctly over-approximates the concrete neural network semantics, providing formal guarantees about the correctness of certification algorithms."

# Neuton
- title: "Neuton"
  description: "Neuton is a compiler and execution framework for ConstraintFlow specifications. It translates high-level declarative certifier specifications into efficient executable implementations, bridging the gap between formally specified analyses and practical large-scale neural network verification."

# SAIL
- title: "SAIL"
  description: "SAIL automatically synthesizes new neural network certifiers by leveraging the ConstraintFlow DSL together with its soundness verifier and compiler. It explores the space of certifier designs and produces new certification procedures that are correct by construction."

# RuleFlow
- title: "RuleFlow"
  description: "RuleFlow automatically generates data-analysis and Pandas optimizations by combining large language models with compiler and program analysis techniques. It targets reusable, rule-based transformations that improve performance while preserving program semantics."

# Automated Theorem Proving
- title: "Automated Theorem Proving"
  description: "This project studies the use of AI and large language models to assist and automate theorem proving. The goal is to support formal reasoning by guiding proof search, generating intermediate lemmas, and helping interact with modern theorem provers."

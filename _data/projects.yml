- title: "ConstraintFlow"
  description: "We develop a ConstraintFlow, a declarative DSL for specifying Abstract Interpretation-based DNN certifiers. It provides a lightweight automatic verification, which can be used to ensure the over-approximation-based soundness of DNN certifiers. We are also building a compiler that can generate an optimized executabels that can run on different hardwares."

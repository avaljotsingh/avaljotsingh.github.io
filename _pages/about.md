I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/) and [Prof. Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com/).

I work at the intersection of **formal methods and artificial intelligence**. My goal is twofold: to build principled, trustworthy AI systems using formal methods (e.g. verification of neural network certifiers and robustness proofs), and to use AI and synthesis techniques to automate and scale formal methods (e.g. synthesizing certifiers and program optimizations, and assisting theorem proving). See the [Research](/research/) page for the two directions and project descriptions.

Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated with Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in May 2021, where I was advised by [Prof. Sanjiva Prasad](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sanjiva/) ([Thesis](/assets/pdf/thesis_aval.pdf)). I have also had the opportunity of working with [Shraddha Barke](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sbarke/) and [Suman Nath](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumann/) at [MSR Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), [Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/) at [MSR India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and [Prof. Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) during my research internships.

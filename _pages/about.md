I am a PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, under the guidance of [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/) and [Prof. Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com/). Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated with Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in May 2021, where I was advised by [Prof. Sanjiva Prasad](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sanjiva/) ([Thesis](/assets/pdf/thesis_aval.pdf)). I have also had the opportunity of working with [Shraddha Barke](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sbarke/) and [Suman Nath](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumann/) at [MSR Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), [Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/) at [MSR India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and [Prof. Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) during my research internships.

<!-- In one direction, I develop declarative and formally verified infrastructures for neural network certification, including the ConstraintFlow DSL, automated soundness verification of certifiers (ProveSound), and a compiler for executable certifier specifications (Neuton). In the other direction, I study how AI can be used to generate and improve formal tools, such as synthesizing new neural network certifiers (SAIL), automatically generating data-analysis optimizations (RuleFlow), and assisting theorem proving. -->

My research is centered on a bidirectional interaction between formal methods and artificial intelligence. On one hand, I develop formal and declarative infrastructures for building trustworthy AI systems using formal methods, with a particular focus on specification, soundness verification, and efficient execution of AI analyses and certification procedures. On the other hand, I study how learning and synthesis techniques can be used to automate and improve formal methods themselves, enabling the automatic construction of verification tools, program analyses, and reasoning procedures. Together, these two directions aim to improve the trustworthiness of AI systems and to substantially reduce the human effort required to build and maintain formal verification frameworks.

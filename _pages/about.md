I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am advised by [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/) and [Prof. Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com/).
My current research is focused on making Neural Networks trustworthy by making it easy to verify properties like robustness using formal methods. We are currently building ConstraintFlow, a DSL for defining Neural Network analysis algorithms.

Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated with Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in May 2021, where I was advised by [Prof. Sanjiva Prasad](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sanjiva/) ([Thesis](/assets/pdf/thesis_aval.pdf)). I have also had the opportunity of working with [Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/) at [MSR India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and [Prof. Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) during my research internships.

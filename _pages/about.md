I am a PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working at the intersection of formal methods and artificial intelligence. My research focuses on both applying formal methods to make neural network systems trustworthy, and using AI and synthesis techniques to automate and scale formal reasoning tools.

In one direction, I develop declarative and formally verified infrastructures for neural network certification, including the ConstraintFlow DSL, automated soundness verification of certifiers (ProveSound), and a compiler for executable certifier specifications (Neuton). In the other direction, I study how AI can be used to generate and improve formal tools, such as synthesizing new neural network certifiers (SAIL), automatically generating data-analysis optimizations (RuleFlow), and assisting theorem proving.

Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated with Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in May 2021, where I was advised by [Prof. Sanjiva Prasad](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sanjiva/) ([Thesis](/assets/pdf/thesis_aval.pdf)). I have also had the opportunity of working with [Shraddha Barke](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sbarke/) and [Suman Nath](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumann/) at [MSR Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), [Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/) at [MSR India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and [Prof. Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) during my research internships.

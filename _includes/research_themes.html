<h2>Formal Methods for AI</h2>

<p>This line of work focuses on building principled and trustworthy AI analysis and certification systems using formal methods. My goal is to make AI analyses and certifiers easier to design, mechanically verifiable for soundness, and efficient to execute, by providing a unified infrastructure that supports specification, formal verification, and compilation of analysis and certification procedures.</p>

<h2>AI for Formal Methods</h2>

<p>This line of work focuses on using machine learning and program synthesis techniques to automate and scale formal methods. My goal is to use AI to generate, improve, and adapt formal analysis tools, optimizations, and reasoning procedures, reducing the manual effort required to design, implement, and maintain verification and analysis systems.</p>
